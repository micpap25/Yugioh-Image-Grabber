# What is this?

This is a really quick framework you can use for getting images of cards using the Yugioh API v7 by YGOProDeck.

Out of the box it will save the relevant JSON file as well as all the cropped images relatedd to the JSON file.

Of course, you can edit it to save other things.

# How do I use this?

Open the Notebook and make any changes you want in the configuration. Use [the official guide](https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/) to learn how to format your `req`.

In the future I'll try to turn this into a commmand line tool.
